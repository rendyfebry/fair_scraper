# Fair Prices Scraper

A scraper to scrap fair prices for travel purpose. For now, it only scrap
airline fair prices. I will try to add another functionality to scrap train fair
prices in the future.

When the scraper succeed, it will send the report into listed email address and
also print it into stdout. You can see the example of printed report below.
